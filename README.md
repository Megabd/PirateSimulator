Pirate Battle Simulator. Project hand-in for High-Performance Game Programming (Autumn 2025) by Emza, Olfw and Bath.

Scene to run Assets/Scenes/SimulationScene.

Ship amount and wheter to run main thread, scheduled or parallel scheduled is set in the scene viewer. This is done under New Sub Scene, which should be enabled, and then in Config.

Other config changes like map size and speed, can be set in the file Assets/CreationSystems/Authering/ConfigAuthering.

If you want to change the camera view in the game this can be done by pressing 1 for following a random blue ship, 2 for following a random red ship and 3 for resetting the camera to the top down view.
